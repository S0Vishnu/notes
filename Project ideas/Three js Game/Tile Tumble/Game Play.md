### **Rules and Gameplay Instructions**

#### **Objective**

Win by either:

1. Reaching the final tile.
2. Establishing the first and only base, maintaining control by manipulating opponents’ movements and strategically using "kill tiles" to eliminate players.

---

#### **Setup**

1. Each player starts with **2000 coins**.
2. Players take turns rolling a **6-sided dice** to move forward on the board.
3. The board contains **green** and **red tiles** with teleportation effects:
    - **Green Tile:** Jump forward randomly (1-40 tiles).
    - **Red Tile:** Jump backward randomly (1-40 tiles).

---

#### **Game Mechanics**

**Teleportation Tiles:**

- **Green Tile:** Moves the player forward up to 40 tiles.
- **Red Tile:** Moves the player backward up to 40 tiles.

**Creating the Only Base:**

- Only **one base** can exist in the game, created by the **first player** to spend **1000 coins** on a base.
- Once a base is created, no other players can build one.

---

**Base Control Mechanism:**

- The player with the base controls **3 adjacent tiles** around it.
- Any opponent landing within the controlled range can be manipulated by the base owner:
    - Force them to skip their turn.
    - Push them forward or backward up to **10 tiles** (costs **100 coins per action**).

**Kill Tiles:**

- The base owner can secretly designate **2 tiles** as "kill tiles."
- **Effect of Kill Tiles:** Any opponent landing on a kill tile is **eliminated from the game** immediately.
- Kill tiles are **invisible to other players** but visible to the base owner.
- Designating or changing a kill tile costs **500 coins** per tile.

**Spending Coins:**

- Players can use their coins strategically:
    1. **Create the Base:** Costs **1000 coins** for the first eligible player.
    2. **Expand Base Range:** Costs **500 coins** per tile to extend the base’s influence.
    3. **Boost Dice Rolls:** Spend **200 coins** to roll a number between 4-6.
    4. **Designate Kill Tiles:** Spend **500 coins** per tile to mark or change a kill tile.

#### **Winning Conditions**

4. **Reach the Final Tile:** The first player to land exactly on the final tile wins.
    - If a dice roll moves a player past the final tile, they remain in place.
5. **Base Domination:** The base owner wins by maintaining dominance, using the base to control and manipulate opponents for **3 consecutive rounds** (no one escapes or disrupts the controlled range).
6. **Eliminate Opponents:** The base owner can also win by using kill tiles strategically to eliminate all other players.

#### **Gameplay Instructions**

7. **Roll Dice:** Players roll a 6-sided dice and move forward accordingly.
8. **Tile Effects:**
    - Land on a **Green Tile** to teleport forward (up to 40 tiles).
    - Land on a **Red Tile** to teleport backward (up to 40 tiles).
9. **Base Creation:**
    - The first player to land on a base-control tile and spend **1000 coins** establishes the only base.
    - Once the base is built, no other bases can be created.
10. **Kill Tiles:**
    - The base owner secretly marks 2 tiles as kill tiles, visible only to them.
    - Opponents landing on kill tiles are eliminated immediately.
11. **Manipulate Opponents:**
    - The base owner can control movements of opponents within the base's range for **100 coins per action**.

#### **Strategic Tips**

- **As the Base Owner:** Use kill tiles strategically on high-traffic areas or teleportation destinations to maximize eliminations.
- **As a Non-Base Player:** Save coins to boost dice rolls and avoid the base’s controlled range.
- Use teleportation tiles wisely to leap ahead or avoid danger zones.
