## **The Portals and Their Puzzles**

Each portal leads to a themed mini-world where the player solves a creative puzzle. The puzzles are designed to be fun and rewarding, with colorful visuals and simple mechanics.

---
### **Puzzle 1: The Glowing Path (Memory Puzzle)**

#### **Scene:**

- A small, circular clearing with a series of glowing stepping stones in front of the orb.

#### **Objective:**

- Step on the stones in the correct order to light the orb's pedestal and unlock it.

#### **Gameplay:**

1. When the player enters the portal, a sequence of glowing stones briefly lights up (e.g., 3–5 stones).
2. The stones reset, and the player must step on them in the same order.
3. If the player steps on the wrong stone, all the stones reset, and the sequence replays as a hint.

#### **Implementation:**

- **Assets Needed**:
    - Basic plane geometries for the stones.
    - A glowing material effect for the lit stones.
- **Logic**:
    - Store the sequence in an array and compare the player's input to the array.
    - Use a simple "reset and replay" mechanic for mistakes.


### **Puzzle 2: The Mystic Bridge (Platform Puzzle)**

#### **Scene:**

- A tranquil pond with floating platforms leading to the orb pedestal on the far side.

#### **Objective:**

- Cross the pond by stepping on platforms that sink after a short delay.

#### **Gameplay:**

1. Platforms float slightly above the water, spaced apart to encourage simple navigation.
2. When the player steps on a platform, it starts sinking slowly (e.g., over 2–3 seconds).
3. The player must cross the pond by timing their jumps correctly.
4. If the player falls, they respawn at the pond's edge to try again.

#### **Implementation:**

- **Assets Needed**:
    - Platforms (e.g., simple boxes or stones with a floating effect).
    - A water plane with a reflective material.
- **Logic**:
    - Use a "timer" for platforms that starts sinking when the player interacts with them.
    - Respawn the player to the starting point on falling.

### **Puzzle 3: The Color Pedestal (Simple Sequence Puzzle)**

#### **Scene:**

- A garden with three glowing pedestals in front of a closed gate holding the orb.

#### **Objective:**

- Place glowing objects in the correct sequence on the pedestals to unlock the orb.

#### **Gameplay:**

1. The garden contains three glowing objects (e.g., colored orbs, flowers, or crystals) scattered nearby.
2. The player collects these objects and places them on the pedestals in a specific order.
3. A clue (e.g., a glowing symbol or a short sequence shown on the gate) tells the player the correct order.
4. If the order is incorrect, the pedestals reset, and the clue reappears.

#### **Implementation:**

- **Assets Needed**:
    - Pedestals and collectible objects (simple meshes with glowing materials).
    - A glowing gate or orb pedestal.
- **Logic**:
    - Use an array to store the correct sequence and compare it with the player’s input.
    - Trigger a success animation or light effect when the sequence is correct.


### **Simplified Game Flow**

1. **Portal Scenes**:
    - Keep the scenes compact to avoid excessive design work.
    - Use simple geometries and textures to define themes (e.g., grass for Puzzle 1, water for Puzzle 2, flowers for Puzzle 3).
2. **Returning to the Main Hub**:
    - After solving a puzzle, teleport the player back to the central tree with a glowing orb appearing near its roots.
3. **Victory Animation**:
    - When all three puzzles are solved, the tree glows brightly, flowers bloom, and a celebratory sound plays.

---

### **Additional Considerations for Simplifying Development**

1. **Reuse Assets**:
    - Use simple shapes and materials (e.g., glowing effects) to minimize modeling work.
2. **Modular Logic**:
    - Design puzzles with reusable mechanics (e.g., sequences, timers) to simplify coding.
3. **Minimal Animations**:
    - Rely on material changes (e.g., glowing effects) and simple movement for feedback.
4. **Kid-Friendly Controls**:
    - Stick to straightforward WASD or arrow keys for navigation and space for jumping.

---

## **Game Loop**

1. **Starting Point**:
    - The player spawns under the giant tree and sees the glowing portals.
    - The tree provides hints or guidance (e.g., glowing branches pointing to unsolved portals).
2. **Entering Portals**:
    - Interacting with a portal transports the player to the puzzle scene.
3. **Solving Puzzles**:
    - The player solves the puzzle and collects the orb.
    - Upon returning, a corresponding rune on the tree lights up.
4. **Victory**:
    - After all three puzzles are solved, the tree glows fully and releases a magical animation (e.g., a giant burst of light, flowers blooming everywhere).

## **Additional Features**

- **Kid-Friendly Exploration**:
    - Butterflies or glowing fireflies guide the player to key objects or puzzles.
    - Visual feedback (e.g., sparkles, glowing trails) ensures the player doesn’t get lost.
- **Ambient Interaction**:
    - Animals like rabbits or birds interact with the player but don’t interfere.
    - Touching the tree causes a ripple effect or gentle hum sound.
- **Encouraging Discovery**:
    - Hidden mini-treasures like glowing mushrooms or tiny sparkling gems reward exploration.
