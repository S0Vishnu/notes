### 1. **Finance Tracking**

- **User Input**:
    - Add expenses manually (amount and category).
    - Add income manually (monthly/weekly).
- **Insights**:
    - Basic budget summary (how much spent, how much saved).

### 2. **Health Tracking**

- **User Input**:
    - Log daily mood (select an emoji).
    - Log sleep hours (simple number input).
- **Insights**:
    - Weekly sleep average.
    - Mood trends displayed visually with emojis.

### 3. **Fitness Tracking**

- **User Input**:
    - Steps or exercise duration (manual input).
- **Insights**:
    - Weekly summary of exercise logged.

### 4. **Dashboard**

- A single page that combines all data:
    - Today’s summary for Finance, Health, and Fitness.
    - Weekly highlights (e.g., savings this week, hours slept).

## **Development Timeline**

### **Phase 1: Planning and Design (1 Week)**

- Define the app structure and sketch basic screens (pen and paper or Figma).

### **Phase 2: Development (4-6 Weeks)**

- Build each feature one at a time:
    - Week 1: Finance tracking (expenses/income, basic summary).
    - Week 2: Health tracking (mood and sleep logging).
    - Week 3: Fitness tracking (manual logging).
    - Week 4: Dashboard integration (combine all data).

### **Phase 3: Testing and Optimization (1 Week)**

- Test on Android and iOS devices.
- Fix any bugs and optimize performance.

### **Phase 4: Launch**

- Publish to Google Play and Apple App Store.



### **Step 1: Build the Web App**

1. **Set Up Your Project**:
    
    - Use **Vite** or **Create React App** for setting up your React project with TypeScript. Vite is faster and more modern.
    - Install necessary dependencies for React:
```bash
	npx create-react-app lazy-life --template typescript 
```
    
2. **Folder Structure**: Keep a clean and modular structure for reusability:
```scss
	src/
	├── components/       // UI components (Button, Card, etc.)
	├── pages/            // Screens like Home, Finance, Health
	├── hooks/            // Custom React hooks for shared logic
	├── utils/            // Helper functions
	├── types/            // TypeScript types and interfaces
	└── App.tsx           // Main App component
```
    
3. **Design the UI**:
    
    - Use a lightweight UI library like **Chakra UI** or **Material-UI** for a responsive, minimalist interface.
    - Components like sliders, buttons, and cards can be styled easily.
    - Build reusable components like `<Card>`, `<InputField>`, and `<SummaryDashboard>`.
4. **Data Storage**:
    
    - Use **localStorage** or **IndexedDB** for storing user data locally in the browser.
    - Libraries like **Dexie.js** simplify working with IndexedDB.
    - Example:
```ts
	    const saveExpense = (expense: { amount: number; category: string }) => {
			const expenses = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('expenses') || '[]');
			expenses.push(expense);
			localStorage.setItem('expenses', JSON.stringify(expenses));
		};
```
